AI-Powered Resume Analyzer
 
An intelligent automation system designed to streamline the recruitment process. This project leverages Machine Learning to transform the way organizations handle job applications by automatically analyzing and categorizing resumes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🌟 Key Strengths
• Automated Intelligence: Eliminates manual sorting by using Machine Learning to classify resumes into relevant industry categories or roles.
• Transparent Workflow: Built entirely in Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring that every step—from data cleaning to model training—is visible and easy to follow.
• Ready for Presentation: Includes a dedicated presentation file specifically designed to showcase the project’s findings and efficiency to stakeholders.
• Scalable Framework: The architecture is designed to handle diverse resume formats and can be expanded to include more complex job categories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized into two primary components that handle the technical heavy lifting and the final delivery:
• Resume_Categorization ML.ipynb: The core engine of the project. This notebook contains the end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
• Pres.ipynb: A structured presentation notebook that summarizes the methodology and results, making it perfect for demonstrating the project's value to non-technical audiences.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have a Python environment set up with:
• Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
• Standard ML libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Launch the notebooks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📊 How It Works
The analyzer follows a professional data science workflow:
1. Data Loading: Imports resume datasets for analysis.
2. Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw text by removing noise.
3. Feature Extraction: Converts textual information into numerical data the AI can understand.
4. Classification: Applies trained models to categorize resumes into specific job sectors accurately.
